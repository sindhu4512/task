## Assigning User Groups

 Creating user based groups and assigning group admins helps in managing users and delegating some admin related tasks to the groups admins. Administrators can create user groups based on user's access limitations. 

 
1. Login to the _ownCloud server_ portal as an administrator.

   The _User administration_ page appears. 
  
2. Click **admin** on the top right corner of the page. 

   A drop-down menu appears. 
 
3. Click the **Groups** drop-down menu and click **+ Add Group**.

   The _Add Group_ page appears.

4. Enter the **Group Name**. 

   A new group is created. You can start assigning users to the group as per the defined access control.
